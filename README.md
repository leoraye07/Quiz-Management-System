## ðŸ“– Introduction

In today's digital world, technology has a significant impact on how we communicate, learn, and grow. Access to digital resources is more essential than ever, especially for students aiming to enhance their technical skills. Our **Online Quiz Website** is designed to provide students with an enjoyable and visually appealing platform to improve their **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** skills.

This website prioritizes **appearance and design** for now, with plans for expanding functionality in future updates. Built using **HTML** and **CSS**, it features a clean, modern layout that ensures easy navigation through three main sections:
- **Home**: A welcoming, neatly designed landing page.
- **Quiz**: The core of the website, where users can take different types and levels of quizzes.
- **About Us**: An overview of the project's vision and goals.

The **Quiz section** offers an interactive and engaging environment for users to test and enhance their HTML knowledge. While the current focus is on design and user experience, our roadmap includes adding interactive features and backend functionality.

This project is valuable because it leverages modern web technology to create a practical, student-friendly study tool. It aims to make learning more efficient, enjoyable, and accessible, while also showcasing our teamâ€™s growing skills in **web development and design**.
